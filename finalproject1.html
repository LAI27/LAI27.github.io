    <p>
      My inspiration for a career in web development was sparked by an Introduction to Programming course I took as an elective for the completetion of my A.A. degree. I changed majors to web development. I knew this was the right choice for me as soon as I
      changed directions. I knew that web development would be a fulfilling career for me. I am currently pursuing my B.S. in web development degree from American Public University. I am thoroughly enjoying learning everything for my degree.
      <br><br> So what is web development anyway? Web developers are responsible for designing and creating websites. Web developers also look at the websites from a technical side of things. Web developers can look at the traffic that a website has.
      A web developer may need to know the type of traffic flow that a website has to make appropriate decisions for hosting.
      <br> The skills of web developers can vary quite a bit. Most developers start out with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These can vary from person to person. For more information on skills and education, please see <a href="finalproject2.html">Web Development Training and Education</a>.<br><br>
