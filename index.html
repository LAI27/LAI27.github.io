      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <!--<div class="fakeimg">Fake Image</div>-->
      <p class="tab">Hello, my name is Lauren Ingram. I was born and raised in beautiful Western North Carolina. In North Carolina, I attended <em>Mayland Community College</em> where I obtained an Associate of Arts degree. It was during my completion of this degree that I found my passion for Web Development and working with computers.<br />
In 2014, I moved to Central Florida. Between January 2017 and August 2018, I studied web development using .NET at <em>American Public University</em>. I graduated in 2018 with a Bachelor of Science in Web Devlopment Using. NET.<br />
During the time I studied for my Bachelor of Science degree, I worked full time at Universal Orlando Resort. I am currently still working at Univesal. I've had many exciting opprotunites and achievments during this time.<br />
I'm excited to see what the future holds. I'm seeking opprotunities to use my web development knowledge and further my skills in the field. 
      <br>
      <h2>Other Interest</h2>
      <!--<div class="fakeimg">Fake Image</div>-->
      <p>Outside of my studies and career, I have so many interest and hobbies that I love.</p>
      <p>Theme parks have been a lifelong interest for me. I moved to Central Florida during 2014 due to my passion for themed entertainment in the area. I've been fortunate for my career to take place in a industry that means so much to me.<br />
      Photography is another one of my passions. I began taking photos about a year and a half ago. I'm not a professional by any means, but I certainly enjoy capturing the moment in photograph. I love vibrant and energtic photos. Some of my work can be viewed <a id="paragraphtext" href="#">here on my Flickr account</a>. I'm improving my Photoshop and Lightroom skills consistantly trying to get that perfect look for every photo.<br />
      When I'm not in a theme park or have a camera in my hands, I love reading, catching up on television shows, or obsessing over movies.</p>
